=Catacomb Snatch Reloaded=
A modified and fixed version of Mojang's mojam game Catacomb Snatch.

Currently my improvements feature improved controls, a chat system, a pause screen, and C418's title and ending music. It also contains bug fixes and underlying code improvements.  With my controls you still look the direction you're walking when not firing, but when firing (using the arrow keys) you aim the direction you're firing.  The pause screen can be entered or exited by any player and allows you to surrender or to toggle the fps counter. 

If you find any bugs, have any suggestions at all, or just want to talk email me at {{{rekh127 [at] gmail [dot] com}}}

A major bug that is still present is the bug with sound on linux. To work around this for now install the Oracle 7 JDK or JRE. To do this on Ubuntu you can use the ppa:webupd8team/java. 
{{{
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install oracle-jdk7-installer
}}}
If you don't wish to do this or you are on another distribution you can manually install the download from oracle.com
